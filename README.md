The link between weight levels and various other factors has become a further topic of interest for study. Through the course of this analysis, the various factors are explored as independent variables with one of the six personal weight levels becoming the dependent variable. By the method of One-Hot encoding, the independent categorical variables were altered to binary variables. At the same time, Label encoding was used to transform the dependent variable, Obesity level, to 0 through 6. Finally, a logistic regression model was used, trained, and verified in an effort to create a machine learning model to predict weight level. This experiment was repeated containing different parameters and re-checked for accuracy.
